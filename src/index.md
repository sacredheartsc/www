Welcome to my personal website. I'm a husband, father of three, and Unix herder.
The HTML you're currently viewing was artisanally crafted in South Carolina.

Professionally, I'm something between a programmer and a system administrator.
Nothing here represents the views of any employer. It's just a collection of my
personal projects and interests, which include digital privacy, self-hosting,
and old-school sysadminning.
